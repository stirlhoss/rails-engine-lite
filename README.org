* Rails Engine
- This is an API that I built from scratch. It is just a simple API that allows calls to retrieve merchants and items that they sell.

** Ruby version
- Built on Rails 5.2.8 and Ruby 2.7.4

** Configuration
- Clone down the repository and =cd= into it.
- Run =bundle= and =rails db:{create,migrate,seed}=
- Start a local rails server with =rails s=

** How to run the test suite
- This app includes a test suite complete with sad path testing.
- To run the test suite, make sure you are in the root of the project and run =bundle exec rspec=
- Testing files are located in =/spec/requests/api/v1=

** Endpoints
